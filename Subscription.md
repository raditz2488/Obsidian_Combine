A subscription object encapsulates a binding between a [[Publisher]] chain(Publisher + operators) and a [[Subscriber]]. This keeps the binding in memory. It controls the lifecycle of a subscription and thus should be kept in around in memory by pointing to it by a property or variable. A subscription can also be cancelled. This ability of cancellation is implemented by the subscription by conforming to the [[Cancellable]] protocol. As a subscription is [[Cancellable]], it gets cancelled when it is deallocated. Optionally subscriptions can be stored in collections which can store [[AnyCancellable]]. A collection storing [[AnyCancellable]] can store subscriptions. When such a collection gets deallocated it calls cancel on all the stored subscriptions.
